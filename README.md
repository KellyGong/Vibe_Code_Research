# Vibe Coding & Vibe Research Tricks

A curated collection of practical tricks, scripts, and tool recommendations for **Vibe Coding** and **Vibe Research** — two emerging paradigms that leverage AI to dramatically boost productivity in software development and academic research.

## What is Vibe Coding / Vibe Research?

- **Vibe Coding**: A workflow where you describe your intent in natural language and let AI handle the heavy lifting of code generation, debugging, and refactoring. You guide the "vibe", the AI writes the code.
- **Vibe Research**: Applying a similar AI-assisted philosophy to academic research — literature surveys, paper summarization, experiment design, data analysis, and writing assistance.
